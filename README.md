# About The Project
    I took the project as a challenge to complete it in minimum time and with high efficiency.
    What I liked the most is the minimalism of the UI but still very informative.
    The only thing I was a little uncomfortable with is it was using 3 fonts which will take extra time to load on the Web.
    This project has many difficulties like the hexagon buttons, the slider containers, the layout of the real-life section, etc
    which I was loving to solve. I have Managed the UI on the responsive as well.
    
# Features-
    1. The Navigation header is sticky to the top on the scroll while the top bar is scrolled up.
    2. It has hexagonal button styles.
    3. It has a product card slider with a hover effect and a container from the left side.
    4. Real-Life Section
    5. BREW GUIDES Section with the button.
    6. Footer with Newsletter Form and Social Media links
    
#Completion time -
    It took me almost 9-11 hours to complete this task.
    
#Pending Items-
    I can not Complete the Real Life Section's parallax effect as I already have created the layout first then I saw the point which indicated to create a parallax.
    This would have taken extra 2-3 hours to create that section again which will lead to more delay.
